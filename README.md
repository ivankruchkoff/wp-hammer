## WARNING
__WARNING__ All changes are final and modify your site DB. Make sure you take a backup of your database __BEFORE__ you play around with the tool ``wp db export``

## Before You Begin
Make a copy of your database.

## About

This tool will help you work on a client's site without having to worry about any of their user's personal information (emails, post content etc) being hosted on your dev environment.

## Installation
Make sure you have [wp-cli](http://wp-cli.org/) installed and in your $PATH. Following that, run this command in your terminal:

`wp package install ivankruchkoff/wp-hammer`

## Usage

With ``wp ha`` you can:

### Clean up user emails.
``wp ha -f users.user_email='ivan.k+__ID__@10up.com'``

### Clean up user passwords.
To auto generate passwords:
``wp ha -f users.user_pass=auto``

To set all passwords to password:
``wp ha -f users.user_pass=password``

### Replace posts with dummy posts.
``wp ha -f posts.post_content=markov,posts.post_title=random``

### Remove extra users.
`` wp ha -l users=10``

### Remove extra Posts.
`` wp ha -l posts=100``


Or you can chain tasks together like in the following  example, which we'll break down in parts as the syntax is fairly powerful
`wp ha -f posts.post_author=auto,users.user_pass=auto,users.user_email='ivan.k+__ID__@10up.com',posts.post_title=ipsum,posts.post_content=markov -l users=10,posts=100.post_date`

``wp ha``
How you invoke the command

### Format
`
wp ha -f posts.post_author=auto users.user_pass=__user_email__UMINtHeroJEreAGleC users.user_email='ivank+__ID__@10up.com' posts.post_title=ipsum posts.post_content=markov
`
``posts.post_author`` is set to a random user ID (from those that will remain after we've performed any adjustments to the users)
`users.user_pass` is set to the user email followed by UMINtHeroJEreAGleC
`users.user_email='ivank+__ID__@10up.com' - __ID__` is replaced by the user ID
`posts.post_title=ipsum` replaces all post_titles with auto-generated lorem ipsum
`posts.post_content=markov` replaces all post_content with randomly generated content, using markov chains for the specified post_content


### Limits
`
-l users=10 posts=page.100.post_date,post.50.post_content.length`
users=10 only the first 10 users remain
`posts=page.100.postdate,post.50.post_content.length `
We keep the following posts:
 `post type = page, 100 posts sorted by postdate, descending
 post type = post, 50 posts with the longest post_content
 `


### Another example
`
wp db import production.sql &&
wp ha posts.post_author=auto,users.user_pass=XGRwPjb7uFD5de23,users.user_email='ivan.k+__ID__@10up.com',posts.post_title=ipsum,posts.post_content=markov -l users=10 &&
wp db export staging.sql
`
